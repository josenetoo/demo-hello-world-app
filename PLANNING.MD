# PLANNING.MD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for creating a simple, Docker-based "hello-world" application. The application will run locally and be accessible via `localhost`. The primary goal is to demonstrate a basic containerized application setup with clear documentation, following best practices.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. In Scope

* **Application:** A minimal web application that serves a "Hello, World!" message.
* **Containerization:** The application will be containerized using Docker.
* **Local Deployment:** The Docker container will run on a local development machine.
* **Accessibility:** The application will be accessible via a web browser at `http://localhost:<port>`.
* **Documentation:** Creation of `PLANNING.MD` (this document), `TASKS.MD`, and `GOLDEN_RULES.MD`.

### 2.2. Out of Scope

* Cloud deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Advanced networking configurations beyond simple port mapping.
* Database integration or other external services.
* User authentication or complex application logic.
* Automated testing frameworks.

## 3. Architecture

The architecture will be straightforward:

1.  **Base Application:** A simple web server. We will use a static HTML file served by Nginx for simplicity and minimal dependencies.
2.  **Docker Image:** A custom Docker image will be built based on an official base image (e.g., `nginx:alpine`). This image will contain the "hello-world" application code (the HTML file).
3.  **Docker Container:** An instance of the Docker image will run as a container on the local machine.
4.  **Port Mapping:** A port on the host machine will be mapped to a port exposed by the Docker container, allowing access to the application via `localhost`.


[Developer Machine (localhost)]
|
| Port Mapping (e.g., 8080 -> 80)
|
[Docker Container]
|
[Nginx Web Server (running on port 80 inside container)]
|
[Serves index.html ("Hello, World!")]


## 4. Technology Choices

* **Containerization:** Docker
    * **Reasoning:** Industry standard for containerization, simplifies deployment, ensures consistency across environments.
* **Base Docker Image:** `nginx:alpine`
    * **Reasoning:** Lightweight, secure, and efficient for serving static content. Alpine Linux base keeps the image size small.
* **Application Code:** A single `index.html` file.
    * **Reasoning:** Simplest way to achieve a "hello-world" web page.
* **Development Environment:** Any OS with Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine on Linux) installed.
* **Version Control:** Git (recommended, though not strictly in scope for the application itself, it's a best practice for managing the Dockerfile and HTML).

## 5. Security Considerations

* **Base Image:** Use official and minimal base images (e.g., `nginx:alpine`) to reduce the attack surface. Regularly update base images.
* **Non-Root User:** While less critical for a simple Nginx serving static files, for more complex applications, run processes inside the container as a non-root user. Nginx official images often handle this correctly by default.
* **Secrets Management:** Not applicable for this simple application, but for real-world apps, never hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles or images.
* **Port Exposure:** Only expose necessary ports.

## 6. Deliverables

1.  `PLANNING.MD`: This document.
2.  `TASKS.MD`: Detailed steps for implementation.
3.  `GOLDEN_RULES.MD`: Best practices for integrating "windsurf principles."
4.  A `Dockerfile`.
5.  An `index.html` file (or the chosen application code).

## 7. Success Criteria

* The Docker image builds successfully.
* The Docker container runs without errors.
* The "Hello, World!" message is accessible in a web browser at `http://localhost:<port>`.
* All three markdown documentation files are complete and accurate.
